## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the iconic Tetris game in Python using the Pygame library. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling blocks, known as Tetriminos, to create complete rows without any gaps. The objective is to clear lines and prevent the blocks from stacking to the top.
